# Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone project

## Libraries used
    sklearn
    keras
    numpy
    random
    cv2
    matplotlib
    tqdm
    tensorflow
    
## Project Motivation

The goal of this project is to build an efficient dog breed classifier using methods of Deep Learning such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning.     
    

## File Descriptions

dog_app.ipynb - A jupyter notebook containing the code

images - Here are all the images that appear in the notebook but are not a part of training/test/validation

## Summary

We succeeded to create a classification model with test accuracy above 77%.

## Acknowledgments

This project was completed thanks to the data, pre-trained models and a sample notebook provided by Udacity.
